# FIN-OCR browser-based demo application

> NOTE: This project is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

This project contains a browser-based application demonstrating how to use [fin-ocr-sdk](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/fin-ocr-sdk). In particular, it performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on data received from a video capture device (e.g. your device's webcam).

To run locally: `npm run debug` and then open on the indicated port, which is `http://localhost:4000` by default.

To build the bundle.js: `npm run build`

> This project was built using https://blog.logrocket.com/using-webpack-typescript/ as a guide.
